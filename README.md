Things you can do with the **CryptStars Dapp**:

 - claim a star
 - find a star that's been claimed
 - exchange stars (*two people can exchange their CryptoStar tokens*)
 - transfer a star

## Getting Started
`npm install -g truffle@5.0.1`

This repository uses:

 - Truffle v5.0.1
 - Solidity (solc) v0.4.24
 - OpenZeppelin-Solidity v2.0.0

### Installation and Getting Started

 1. Clone the repository
 ```
 $ git clone [repo]
 ```

 2. Install NPM packages at top-level needed for truffle contracts and unit tests
```
$ npm run build
```

 3. Create the empty mnemonic and infuraKey files (to run the Dapp against the Rinkeby network later)
 ```
 $ touch .mnemonic
 $ touch .infuraKey
 ```

 4. Run the truffle development environment
 ```
 $ truffle develop
 ```
 
 5. Compile the contracts and migrate from within `truffle develop`
 ```
compile
migrate
 ```
 
 6. Run the contract unit tests *(optional)* from within `truffle develop`
 ```
test
```

 7. In another terminal window (**not from** `truffle develop`) install Webpack and other packages needed for the Dapp front-end
 
 ```
 $ cd app
 $ npm install
 $ npm run build
 $ npm run dev
 ```

### Running the CryptoStars Dapp (locally)
 
 1. Setup your MetaMask by adding a *Custom RPC* pointing to the Truffle development network: http://localhost:9545
 
 2. Add a few accounts to MetaMask using the private key import feature
 
 3. Open browser and go to http://localhost:8080
 
 4. You're all set to try claiming, finding, exchanging, and transferring  CryptoStars!

 ### Running the CryptoStars Dapp (on the Rinkeby Test Network)

 1. Modify the *mnemonic* and *infura.io* config files
    a. Add your Metamask seed words to the `.mnemonic` file
    b. Create an *Infura.io* project and add the *Project ID* to `.infuraKey`

 2. Setup Metamask to point to the Rinkeby network
 
 3. Add the *CST custom token* to your Rinkeby account(s)

 4. Open a terminal window and run the Webpack development server
 ```
 $ cd app
 $ npm run dev
 ```
 
 6. Open browser and go to *http://localhost:8080*
